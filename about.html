  <h1 class="Title">We at DogWalking Co are dedicated to walking your dogs</h1>
  <p class="titleDescription">
    We know your pup is precious cargo and you deserve the peace of mind of knowing they are navigating busy city streets safely. With Dogwalking & Co you can relax knowing the safety of our pack mates and pack leaders is our number one focus. Period. There are many ways we ensure pack safety; our comprehensive and extensive Pack Leader Training, Pet First Aid training, appropriate pack sizes, compatible dog personalities, and adjusting the walk times during inclement weather. But our most helpful tool in ensuring safety is our custom-made safety clips. By using a collar, harness, and safety clip on each and every dog in our pack, we are ensuring they are completely secure and are able to prevent any collar from slipping.
